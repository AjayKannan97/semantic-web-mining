### **CSE 573 - Semantic Web Mining Mid-Term Exam Summary**  

For the midterm, I implemented and analyzed key concepts of **Semantic Web Mining**, focusing on data extraction, knowledge representation, and machine learning techniques applied to semantic data. The project was structured to explore various methodologies for mining meaningful insights from structured web data.  

#### **Key Elements from the Repository**  

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
   - Collected semantic data from RDF (Resource Description Framework) sources.  
   - Parsed data using **SPARQL queries** to retrieve relevant information.  
   - Preprocessed extracted data for feature engineering and model compatibility.  

2. **Ontology-Based Knowledge Representation**  
   - Designed an ontology to represent relationships between entities.  
   - Utilized **OWL (Web Ontology Language)** to define classes, properties, and constraints.  
   - Applied reasoning techniques to infer new knowledge from the dataset.  

3. **Machine Learning for Semantic Web**  
   - Implemented **Graph-Based Learning** techniques for knowledge extraction.  
   - Used **Word2Vec and RDF2Vec** embeddings to encode semantic relationships.  
   - Applied **classification and clustering algorithms** to categorize and group entities.  

4. **Evaluation & Results**  
   - Evaluated the effectiveness of the models using precision, recall, and F1-score.  
   - Visualized results using **Network Graphs** to illustrate semantic relationships.  

#### **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrated how **Semantic Web Mining** combines **Web Data Extraction, Ontology Engineering, and Machine Learning** to create intelligent systems capable of understanding and interpreting web-based structured data.
